# Peer-to-Peer Bomberman Game

## Introduction

This is an implementation of the popular bomberman game for browsers using HTML5. The interesting thing is, that it uses most recent WebRTC technology to allow playing multiplayer games via a direct peer to peer (i.e. browser to browser) communication.

## Demonstration

*Please note:* This is just a showcase. The software contains some bugs as well as WebRTC itself is not fully implemented in the browsers and a lot a features are missing. For example, Firefox and Chrome can still not talk to each other via a `RTCDataChannel`.
