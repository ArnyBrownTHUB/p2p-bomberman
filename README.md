Peer-to-Peer Bomberman Game
===========================

This is an implementation of the popular bomberman game for browsers using HTML5. The interesting thing is, that it uses most recent WebRTC technology to allow playing multiplayer games via a direct peer to peer (i.e. browser to browser) communication.

This game uses the [peer.js](http://peerjs.com) library and requires you to have a running peer.js-server.

*Please note:* This is just a showcase. The software contains some bugs as well as WebRTC itself is not fully implemented in the browsers and a lot a features are missing. For example, Firefox and Chrome can still not talk to each other via a RTCDataChannel.
